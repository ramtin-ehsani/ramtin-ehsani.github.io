      <description>This is a concise, step-by-step guide on how to build a website - just like this one - with Hugo, and host it on Github. Follow the steps and check out the links for further explanation on each component. This guide is made for non-experts, because I found most Hugo tutorials utterly useless and sparse for people new to computers web-development.&#xA;It might look daunting at first to go through all these steps below, but the reward is that once you get it right, updating and maintaining your website will be incredibly fast and easy.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a Ph.D. candidate currently studying at Drexel University. My major is Computer Science. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a reserach assistant in SOAR Lab, and my current focus is on automated program repair and utilizing large language models to enhance software engineering tasks, such as issue resolution. I am broadly interested in advancing AI-driven approaches for improving software tools and environments.&#xA;Download CV Link to heading Education Link to heading 2023-present PhD in Computer Science, Drexel University | PA, USA</description>
