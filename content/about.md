Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate currently studying at Drexel University. My major is Computer Science. I'm currently working as a reserach assistant in SOAR Lab, and my current focus is on automated program repair and utilizing large language models to enhance software engineering tasks, such as issue resolution. I am broadly interested in advancing AI-driven approaches for
improving software tools and environments.
