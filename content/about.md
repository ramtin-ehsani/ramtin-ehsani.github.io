Hi! I’m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Drexel University and a research assistant in the SOAR Lab. My research focuses on automated program repair, where I study how large language models can generate reliable, trustworthy program fixes. Beyond program repair, I am broadly interested in advancing AI-driven approaches that enhance issue resolution, developer productivity, and the reliability of software engineering tools.
